# Setup

Firstly, create a discord bot using [discord.dev](https://discord.dev) website. 
Then, copy the `BOT_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID` and paste it in the `/custombot` command.
If you don't have any bot set, the bot should send an information about this.

Then, invite the bot to your server using the following link: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8` (replace `BOT_ID` with your bot's client ID).

After providing correct `BOT_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`, you should see a buttons panel with the following options:

 - `Turn bot <on/off>` - turns the bot on or off

 - `Deploy bot commands` - deploys the bot commands to the discord servers. Requires permissions.
